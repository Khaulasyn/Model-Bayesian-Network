# Bayesian Network for Disease Diagnosis

This project uses a Bayesian Network to predict disease diagnoses based on genetic and geographic patterns.

## Structure
- **GeneticFactor**: Presence of genetic markers.
- **GeographicLocation**: Region associated with varying disease risk.
- **Disease**: Target disease outcome.
- **Age**: Age-related risk factors.

## Usage
1. Load your genetic and geographic data into `data/genetic_data.csv` and `data/geographic_data.csv`.
2. Run the `models/bayesian_network.py` to build and evaluate the model.
